# π Test Assignment
This is a single page web performance report showcasing the Chrome User Experience Report (CruX) data for a selected website:

![Core Web Vitals Checker Preview](core-web-vitals-checker-preview.png)

To complete this test, you will have to use JavaScript, HTML and CSS to build the design and functionality described below.

> β± **We have scoped this task to 8 hours.** Please try to avoid exceeding this limit. Itβs okay if you donβt finish the task: follow the steps in the [How To Submit](#-how-to-submit) section!

## π¨ Design Specification
Review the [design file in Figma](https://www.figma.com/file/gRsIi7uODaoGyQuPS9Z79b/Front-end-Developer-Test-UI?node-id=0%3A1). To access the file and [inspect the properties](https://help.figma.com/hc/en-us/articles/360055203533-Use-the-Inspect-panel) of specific elements you will need a Figma account.

To complete this task, the following design criteria have to be met:

* The implementation has to **reflect the design file**.
* The design uses Inter font, which is available on [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Inter).
* The page should be responsive (as documented). Feel free to use your best judgement to adjust element behaviour in-between those resolutions.
* The measurement colours and corresponding labels **depend on thresholds** set for each metric (please refer to [the table below](#-metric-thresholds)).

### π Metric Thresholds

| Metric name | Poor | To Improve | Good |
|---|---|---|---|
| Largest Contentful Paint | above 4s  | 2.51-4s | 2.5s or less |
| Cumulative Layout Shift |  above 0.25 | 0.11-0.25 |  0.10 or less |
| First Input Delay | above 300ms | 101ms-300ms | 100ms or less |
| First Contentful Paint |  above 3s  | 1.81-3s | 1.80s or less |

## π  Functionality Specification

To complete this task, the following functional criteria have to be met:

* You should **pull the data** for four performance metrics from the [CruX API](https://web.dev/chrome-ux-report-api/). If you wish, you can use alternative libraries to communicate with the API.
* Retrieve the data for `https://google.com/` origin. 
* The metrics you obtain from the API should be **formatted accordingly** (unit or unitless depending on the metric type and no more than two decimal points).
* The `report header` (with the dark blue background) section can be entirely hard-coded.
